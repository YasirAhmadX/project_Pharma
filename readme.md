# Project Phrama
* By Yasir - October 2023

### Motive
Project Pharma is a PoC application that will allow multiple pharmacy stores and operation centres to
collaborate and share data. The private information of the customer will be stripped and replaced with 
unique IDs. The quantity of medicines sold by stores can indicate the potential trends, rising 
infections, virals, etc. 

### Methodology
This project will use distributed architecture to store the sals data of multiple stores. This data will
then be processed to identify the increasing demand of particular drugs, rising sales of medicines, 
infection, virals, etc and calculate the heatmaps and hotspots of infection, and predict the number of
future cases.
